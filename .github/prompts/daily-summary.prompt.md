## Automation Notes

- When creating the daily summary, first extract all Markdown links (for example: [Title](Link)) from the target file and create a list of referenced files.
- For any referenced files whose content has not yet been retrieved, obtain the content of all such files.
- After retrieving the content of all referenced files, begin generating the summary.
- When generating the summary, reflect the content of referenced files as appropriate, and indicate references using Markdown links as needed.
- Insert the summary as a `## AI Generated Summary` section immediately before the `## Mobile First Daily Interface` section.
- Do not repeat unchanged content; use concise comments or markers as needed.
- No need to link to the base file.
- Always check the content of referenced files and reflect them in the summary and each item as appropriate.
- Use Markdown link format without file extensions, for example: [title](basename).
- Avoid excessive speculation; summarize concisely based on records and links.
- Follow the specified format, length, and style for each item.
